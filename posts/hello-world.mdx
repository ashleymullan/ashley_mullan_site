I recently earned my M.S. in Statistics from the [Department of Statistical Sciences at Wake Forest University](https://stats.wfu.edu/), where I worked with [Dr. Sarah Lotspeich](https://www.sarahlotspeich.com/) on methods to handle 📏 *measurement error* 📏 and their exciting applications to the study of 🥦 *local food access* 🥦. <br /> I 💜 working with data and talking about *New Girl*, sometimes even [at the same time](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bRwA-At8TQ853uAKEudn6Ol84eFd4LJp/view?usp=sharing)! <br /> Here is my most recent [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LIiYja1NUyEcYfVxzFTopPOKvuyHqtIT/view?usp=sharing).
