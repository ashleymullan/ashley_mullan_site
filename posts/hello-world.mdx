👋 Hi, and welcome to my website! I'm **Ashley**, an M.S. student at Wake Forest University. I currently work with [**Dr. Sarah Lotspeich**](https://www.sarahlotspeich.com/) on methods to handle 📏 *measurement error* 📏 and their exciting applications to the study of 🥦 *local food access* 🥦. I 💜 working with data and talking about *New Girl*, sometimes even [at the same time](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bRwA-At8TQ853uAKEudn6Ol84eFd4LJp/view?usp=sharing)!
